## Practice problem set

1. [ ] Use Python library for 

   1. [ ] Apriori

      Test it with more pattern Evaluation/interest measures eg. Lift,  conviction, leverage, collective strength

   2. [ ] Bayes (or) Decision tree

      More measures of classifier accurace [F1 score, Specificity, Sensitivity, Recall, Precision, Area under curve]

   3. [ ] K-means

      Radius, Diameter, Purity of cluster (homogenity), Z3 Measures

2. [ ] Explore all FIM library support in Python
3. [ ] DIC Implementation in Python w/o Library
4. [ ] Efficient version of Agglomerative clustering (Min-heap)[Reduction in time complexity]
5. [ ] Implement ARBC(Association Rule Based Classifier)
