## Practice problem set

1. [x] Use Python library for 

   1. [x] Apriori

      Test it with more pattern Evaluation/interest measures eg. Lift,  conviction, leverage, collective strength

   2. [x] Bayes (or) Decision tree

      More measures of classifier accurace [F1 score, Specificity, Sensitivity, Recall, Precision, Area under curve]

   3. [x] K-means

      Radius, Diameter, Purity of cluster (homogenity), Z3 Measures

2. [x] Explore all FIM library support in Python
3. [ ] DIC Implementation in Python w/o Library
4. [ ] Efficient version of Agglomerative clustering (Min-heap)[Reduction in time complexity]
5. [x] Implement ARBC(Association Rule Based Classifier)
