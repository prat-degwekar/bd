## Assignment 3

[ ] Implement a variant of the Decision Tree Classification algorithm which uses Simple Genetic Algorithm to prioritize the selection of paths to generate class label. You may redirect the tree output of a built in Decsion Tree classifier as if then rules and then perform GA operation using an appropriate fitness measure.

[ ] Test Drive the Problem in 1 using  bucket brigade strategy of fitness apportionment.

[ ] Test Drive the BPN classification algorithm for a large data set of your choice (use of built in support / user defined functions is fine).

[ ] Test Drive the other variants of Neural Network classifiers supported in Python / R  and analyse the results in comparsion to the above.
